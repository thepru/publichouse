### Panel One 
**FRONT OF THE PUB - WHATEVER TIME**  
PIGGINS and NEWT stand in the low fog, both in hats: PIGGINS a sort of bowler or pork-pie, NEWT a tophat

**PIGGINS ([about Piggins][p]):**  
Season’s upon us!  
—So soggy & warm tho—  
It hits different…

**NEWT ([about Newt][n]):**  
Yep.

### Panel Two
**INSIDE THE PUB, PUB-GOER’S SIDE OF THE BAR**  
PIGGINS and NEWT sit on their stools. PIGGINS with a pint, his hat on the bar, NEWT with a sipper of the fancy, hat on, but soggy.

**PIGGINS:**  
Its stagnation…what else?

**NEWT**
Better ta have stagnation of place—than of the person!

### Panel Three
NEWT explains, PIGGINS resists slightly, crossing arms and closing eyes.

**NEWT:**
“The body: as biome”

**PIGINS:**
This one’ll ease inta the bog soon enough…

### Panel Four
NEWT spins away from the bar a bit, holding his sipper, and gesticulating his arm as he predicts future events. PIGGINS looks over, his eyes open, but shopping short and narrowed, supposing of his own destuiny in NEWT‘S reality.

**NEWT:**
Maybe, by then, it'll be a real pea-souper!!

**PIGGINS:**
Hope so. I could use the privacy.
