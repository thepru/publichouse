### Panel One 
**NO PLACE**  
PIGGINS stands up his hellbox, a stiff cardboard box, not unlike a soapbox. Contemplative, holding a sweet tobacco roll. A half glass of stout sit by the box on the ground

**PIGGINS ([about Piggins][p]):**  
Well, we do what we can, lawd knows…  
—Not lookin' back so as ta become a pillr’-o-salt!  
Nope.

### Panel Two
He holds his hand up, eyes closed, explaining

**PIGGINS:**  
Just sittin’ here as best I can. Tryin’—to be, the best damn pig I can be?

### Panel Three
PIGGINS turns to the right, arms crossed, looking up and away a bit thining

**PIGGINS:**  
Here on the corner, where a couple of
non-places meet up…  
Yappin’ to the whole world.  
My sweet accountability partner.

### Panel Four
He turns back left, right hand on chest, rubbing or resting while the realizations come in, while his left arm dangles

**PIGGINS:**  
Hell! It’s my medium! My dear substrate… I know it to be so.  
And though it is I who crafts…  
My mark is your mark.
