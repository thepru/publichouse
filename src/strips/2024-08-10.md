### Panel One 
**FRONT OF THE PUB - LATE EVENING**  
PIGGINS stands on the pub’s front sidewalk, facing out, it’s saloon-style doors showing behind him. Over him, the pub sign—usually showing a semi-full pint, instead doubles as his speech balloon, reading ‘the as it should be’ (essentially completing the strip’s title as spoken by Piggins). His hands are out, his words self-convincing.

**PIGGINS ([about Piggins][p]):**  
Easin’ in to another night at the as it should be.

### Panel Two
**INSIDE THE PUB, AT THE BAR**  
PIGGINS continues, eyes closed, sloshing his beer in hand, almost toasting to his verbal testament

**PIGGINS:**  
Uh Huh… Things r’ just good n’ right.

### Panel Three
PIGGINS, turning, his beer at rest, explains further…

**PIGGINS:**  
I mean, there’s no other way it could be…

Becuz, if yer comin’ from the “it is what it is” saloon, well, our drinks might taste a lil’ off…

### Panel Four
He turns again, seemingly less convinced now–one hand gripping the bar, the other by his side.

**PIGGINS:**  
But we sip em’ anyway…  
—nestled as we are—  
…in our lil’ sphere o’ control  
—it’s kinda nice, no?
