### Panel One 
**FRONT OF THE PUB - 10 AT NIGHT**  
PIGGINS stands on sidewalk, back turned, facing the road. Over him, the pub sign swings in the wind. It shows a pint of beer, with the text ‘Maybe…’ above it. He’s in a zipped-up jacket with no hood, hands in pockets. He’s got a pint himself, sitting by his feet; he’s smoking, as per normal.

**PIGGINS ([about Piggins][p]):**  
 …The problem with the world is peeps think’n they gotta be big.

### Panel Two
He turns facing, puts a hand towards his chin, thinking…

**PIGGINS:**  
Really tho—small is good. Be small, be quick!

### Panel Three
Turning away again, hands back in pockets, posture a little more slumped.

**PIGGINS:**  
Revise & reflect. Do what you can.
