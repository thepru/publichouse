### Panel One 
**PIGGINS IN A NUETRAL SETTING, NO BACKGROUND; COULD BE ANYWHERE**  
PIGGINS ponders, standing with one hand holding his sweet tobacco twist, the other on his chin. His white T-shirt shows the outline of a heart.  

**PIGGINS ([about Piggins][p]):**  
Do we gotta destroy everything before we can have anything?

### Panel Two
T-shirt shows the outline of an indifferent face in the smiley face-style.  

**PIGGINS**  
…And it took this long?

### Panel Three
T-shirt shows the text ‘NO!’

**PIGGINS**  
Seems like it.
