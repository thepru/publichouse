### Panel One 
Piggins - [learn more about Piggins][p]: Swell! Welcome to this edition of ye ole sweet Hellbox! It is with some amount of irony that the Boxx presents to you a little dollap o’ wisdom—a ‘spin’! —if ya will—on the Golden Rule of old…

### Panel Two
Piggins: I mean… Take it as you may. But wow it really offers some tasty nuance. So let’s not bury the damn lede much longer! …It’s the ‘Reverse Golden Rule’. That’s right!—We’re reverse’n the polarity!!

### Panel Three
Piggins: Like so many plot wrap-ups, with the final commercial break dispensed with… “Whatever you don’t want done to you, do not do to another”[^1] Simple huh? It’s more applicable to the unforced notion ya see…

### Panel Four
Piggins: Say—those that stream out of your default state—aside from your unique nature—keepin’ that to tha side ‘cos damn! Are we not just a series of states?? We’re tryin’ ta keep to together, that’s all… But the default state sure is a doozy!
