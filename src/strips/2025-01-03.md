### Panel One 
**IN THE PUB - COULD BE ANYTIME**  
PIGGINS sits at the bar, with a half-full beer and a bowl filled with a mound of something. NEWT, beside him, after a quip from Piggins, inquires…

**PIGGINS ([about Piggins][p]):**  
It’s been a bad week sweet Newt!

**NEWT ([about Newt][n]):**  
Yer down to cold bits and beer broth I see…

### Panel Two
Piggins wheels around, gripping the bowl, football-like, while holding the next morsal in his opposite hand.

**NEWT:**  
At least let me treat you to some hot beans and rice?

**PIGGINS:**  
Nay. It’s expected. The okra tops and b.b. will see me through…

**NEWT:**  
‘Expected?’

### Panel Three
Things calm, and conversation continues:

**PIGGINS:**  
Ya know: ebbs, flows, peaks, valleys… the price of freelancin’.  
Hmmm…

**NEWT:**  
Err… Or—“odd-jobbin’”, as you say.

**PIGGINS:**  
Is it ‘eek, or is it ‘eck’-o-nomics?

### Panel Four
Piggins slops down more tops, split droplets fly, but it’s under control

**NEWT:**  
—Whatever works best for you!

**PIGGINS:**  
—‘Heck’

**NEWT:**  
—Wha?

**PIGGINS:**  
‘Heckonomics’ is wut works for me!
